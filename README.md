## Description
Contagion Complex is game about halting the disease apocalypse through creating drugs in a government run clinic. 
The diseases the player is fighting take a note from Theme hospital, being somewhat more comedic in appearance.
The game is currently being imagined as Fallout Shelter’s building mechanic meets the reverse of plague Inc. 
Players earn money by creating drugs to cure diseased individuals brought in by the government.
Players will have to create the cures before the diseased individuals die due to their illness, causing them to fail.
